### 📊 Output Explanation

**Column Meanings:**
- **Current**: Real-time price from live APIs
- **Predicted**: Model's price forecast for the time horizon
- **Return**: Expected percentage change from current to predicted price

**Direction Indicators:**
- **🟢 Green Circle**: Model predicts price will go **UP**
- **🔴 Red Circle**: Model predicts price will go **DOWN**

**Confidence Levels (Stars):**
- **⭐** = Very low confidence (50-60%)
- **⭐⭐** = Low confidence (60-70%)
- **⭐⭐⭐** = Medium confidence (70-80%)
- **⭐⭐⭐⭐** = High confidence (80-90%)
- **⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐** = Very high confidence (90-100%)

### 🔬 Model Components Explained

**Two XGBoost Models Work Together:**

1. **Price Prediction (Return %)**: 
   - **XGBoost Regressor** trained on 89 features (technical indicators, market correlations, economic data)
   - Predicts exact price target and calculates return percentage vs current price
   - Used for: "Predicted: $43,450.00" and "Return: +0.46%"

2. **Direction Prediction (🔴🟢)**: 
   - **XGBoost Classifier** trained on the same 89 features
   - Binary classification: Will price go UP or DOWN from historical baseline?
   - Used for: 🟢 (UP) or 🔴 (DOWN) circles

3. **Confidence Score (⭐)**: 
   - Based on the direction classifier's probability output
   - Higher confidence = model is more certain about the direction
   - Calculated as distance from 50% probability (closer to 0% or 100% = higher confidence)

**Data Sources (No News Sentiment):**
- Technical indicators: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, moving averages
- Market correlations: S&P 500, Gold, Dollar Index, VIX relationships  
- Economic indicators: Fed rates, inflation, GDP, unemployment (via FRED API)
- Price history: Lagged features and momentum indicators

**Why Direction and Return % Can Differ:**
The regressor and classifier are trained independently on the same data but optimize for different objectives. The regressor predicts exact prices, while the classifier focuses on directional movement patterns. This can lead to scenarios where the direction shows 🟢 (UP) but return % is negative, meaning the model expects upward movement from the historical training baseline but the current real-time price is already higher than the predicted target.

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

Add these to your `.env` file:
```
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_key_here
FRED_API_KEY=your_key_here
NEWS_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

## 🧠 How It Works

### Two-Script Architecture

This bot uses an optimized two-script workflow:

#### 1. **train_optimal_models.py** - The Heavy Lifter 🏋️
- **Purpose**: Finds optimal training windows and trains production models
- **Process**: 
  - Tests 6 different training window sizes (1 month → 4 months)
  - Runs 30 backtests per window to find the best performing setup
  - Trains final production models using optimal windows
  - Saves trained models to `models/` directory
- **Run**: Once initially, then weekly/monthly for reoptimization
- **Output**: Pre-trained models ready for immediate use

#### 2. **crypto_prediction_bot.py** - The Speed Demon ⚡
- **Purpose**: Makes real-time predictions using pre-trained models  
- **Process**:
  - Loads optimal models from `models/` directory (instant startup)
  - Collects recent data and generates predictions
  - No training delays - immediate predictions
- **Run**: Continuously for live predictions
- **Fallback**: Can still train from scratch if no pre-trained models exist

### Workflow Benefits
- **🚀 Instant startup**: Bot loads pre-trained models immediately
- **🎯 Optimized accuracy**: Models use scientifically determined optimal training windows
- **⚡ Efficiency**: No wasted compute retraining every time
- **🔄 Flexible**: Can retrain/reoptimize models as needed

### Data Collection
- **Crypto prices**: CoinGecko API (free, no registration)
- **Traditional markets**: Yahoo Finance (S&P 500, Gold, Dollar Index, VIX)
- **Economic data**: FRED API (Federal Reserve economic indicators)
- **Rate limiting**: Respects free API limits automatically

### Feature Engineering
- **Technical indicators**: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Moving Averages
- **Market correlations**: Rolling correlations with traditional assets
- **Time features**: Hour, day, weekend effects, market sessions
- **Lagged features**: Price history and momentum indicators
- **Volume analysis**: Price-volume relationships

### Machine Learning
- **XGBoost models**: Separate regression and classification models
- **Feature selection**: Selects top 50 most predictive features
- **Time series validation**: Prevents data leakage with proper splits
- **Multi-horizon**: Different models for 15m, 1h, and 4h predictions
- **Ensemble approach**: Combines price and direction predictions

### Prediction Types
- **Price targets**: Absolute price predictions
- **Return percentages**: Expected percentage change
- **Direction**: Up/down movement with confidence scores
- **Confidence levels**: Model certainty (0-100%)
